Image Classification Using MNIST Dataset

This project demonstrates a basic neural network model implemented using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is designed to recognize digits (0-9) based on the provided training data and evaluate its performance on test data.


Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, with each image normalized and labeled accordingly.

Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

TensorFlow

Keras (included in TensorFlow)

Usage

Load the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow's built-in keras.datasets.mnist module.

Preprocess the data by normalizing pixel values to a range of 0 to 1.

Compile the model with appropriate configurations (loss function, optimizer, and metrics).

Train the model on the training data and validate it using test data.

Use the trained model for predictions on new input data.

Future Improvements

Adding dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

Experimenting with different optimizers and activation functions.

Expanding the model to support additional image classification tasks.
